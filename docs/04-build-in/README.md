# Build-in blocks

Robindoc provides several built-in extensions for markdown.

Since the framework is focused specifically on markdown. This makes it possible to maintain the same style for all platforms. The user can quickly view the original files, and then use the full documentation site. And in both cases he will receive all the necessary information.

However, in all non-standard situations you can [use JSX](../01-getting-started/02-writing-md.md).

> [!NOTE]
> All built-in markdown elements can be customized by overwriting their rendering components. See [Tags](../03-customization/07-tags.md) for more details.
